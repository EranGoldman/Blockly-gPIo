# Blockly-gPIo
GPIO visual programming for raspberry pi with simple browser-based simulation.

Currently this is just a proof of concept, not even an MVP, hacked together in a small amount of time.

Inspired by a talk from [bennuttall](https://github.com/bennuttall) about [gpiozero](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-gpiozero).
